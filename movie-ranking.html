 <h2>The top 3 favorite movies are</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Sidelined:The QB and me</h3>
 <p>This is my all time favorite rom-com genre movie because it is very unfiltered and has very less toxicity.</p>

 <h3>Yeh Jawani hai Deewani</h3>
 <p>This is definitely my comfort movie because it is about travelling with friends.<br />
    The way all the friends stay in touch despite of all the distance that they have inspiers me to keep up withmy friendship.

 <h3>Fifty Shades of Grey</h3>
 <p>As a dark romance novel reader I love to watch and read movies like this.</p>
